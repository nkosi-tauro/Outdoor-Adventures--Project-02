                  <h2  class="animate-text">  Probably the second most well-known hiking trail in Cape Town (after Lion’s Head), Platteklip is not so easygoing, despite its popularity. Sure, there’s not much climbing or scrambling involved, but there’s a lot of upward walking, which probably makes it the ideal route for a workout. <br><br> <i class="fa fa-clock fa-sm" >  Duration: 4hours</i> <br><br><i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-sm">  Need to know: Platteklip is best avoided on a hot day, as there is little shade to be found along the trail.
                    Be prepared for all types of weather, and bring a hat, sunblock and jacket.
                    Proper hiking shoes are required; do not attempt this trail with slip-slops.
                    If you plan to take the cable car down, make note of operational times and ensure you reach the station before the last cable car leaves.</i></h2>

Many of these trails are not beginner-friendly, and they are not recommended for children or dogs.
                    If you do have a guide, it’s recommended to visit Tranquility Cracks, a hidden gem that Capetonian hikers have only recently discovered. </i> </h2>
